# Steam-Blocker
This method about 10 years old and is outdated compared to Koalageddon, just uploading this for prevservation sake.

# How this works
Allows playing shared games without getting kicked off when friend starts playing their games library. Person 1 would launch a shared game from Person 2's library and will then launch steam blocker and block steam. Once this is done Person 2 can start any game from their library and play without affecting Person 1. Steam Blocker then has to be turned off when they are done or steam won't work properly.
